# ReadMe currently undergoing refactor to capture complete scope and achievements of ONGOING project.

# Hello, and welcome to my microservices exploration project!

## Project Goals
- Familiarize myself with the modern tools used to develop highly scalable software.
- Develop understanding of microservice architecture.
- Improve cloud computing knowledge.

## Motivation 
"We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit." - Aristotle <br>
I have a strong desire to develop excellent cloud software that runs ultra-lean, utilizing minimal resources.

## Background
This project is based on the contents of Bootstrapping Microservices by Ashley Davis. <br>
However, where Davis uses Node.js, I've opted to use Spring Boot. Thus, I want to stress that this project isn't a simple fork of the project files provided by Davis but rather a complete port of the project. <br><br>
The decision was made to use Spring Boot for a few reasons:
- Increase challenge and therefore knowledge gained.


## Current Application State
- [X] Deploy architecture required for a single service using Terraform.
- [X] Deploy microservice when merged into 'main'.
- [X] Access application through a public IP.
- [X] Pass messages between microservices using a message broker (RabbitMQ).
- [ ] 

## Future Milestones
- [ ] Deploy Azure Storage with Terraform.
- [ ] Define Kubernetes deploy.yaml file for all microservice projects.
- [ ] Add unit and integration tests to all microservice projects.
- [ ] Integrate unit and integration tests into GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline.
- [ ] Expand scope of GitHub Actions to all microservice projects.
- [ ] Integrate with UI.
